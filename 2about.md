    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>As a dynamic and creative software engineer with over 8 years of experience, I have honed my skills in various technical domains, including networking, software development, malware analysis, and vulnerability analysis and penetration testing (VAPT). I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in IT from Delhi College of Engineering and am currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Boston University.

My expertise spans across multiple programming languages and technologies, such as C/C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, ELK Stack, MEAN Stack, and numerous cybersecurity tools. Serving as an Assistant Commandant (Technical) in the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), I have spearheaded the development of high-performance Android and web applications, expertly analyzed and neutralized live malware, performed meticulous security audits, and created guidelines promoting safe and responsible technology usage.

Throughout my career, I have undertaken various impactful projects, including detecting vulnerabilities in VS Code extensions, designing password crackers, conducting cybersecurity audits, and developing data visualization dashboards, web applications, and mobile solutions. With my extensive experience and unique skill set, I am confident in my ability to make a significant impact in the technology industry.</p>
